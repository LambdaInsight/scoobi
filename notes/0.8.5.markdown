Maintenance version

### Improvements

* using wire formats to serialise `DObjects`
* added a WireFormat for `java.util.Map[A, B]`
* set the classpath diagnostics as debug info on the client by default
* simplified the use of overwritable text file output format
* added an overwritable text file sink
* added the possibility to fully specify the temp directory with `scoobi.workingdir` and `scoobi.tempdir`
* display only the sink id when pretty printing the graph
* added methods to use an Emitter in the combine phase
* added the possibility to use the task input output context in a `parallelDo`
* added the possibility to access the configuration from a map operation
* throw an exception if the compression codec is not available added a method to check the availability of a codec
* added a "download" sink to collect downloaded files in map tasks

### Fixes

* fixed the passing of `WireFormat` when transforming a `Combine` node in a `ParallelDo`
* fixed the numbering of steps
* set the configuration if possible on the codec before getting its compressor
* fix for checkpoints when one job fails In that case the `_SUCCESS_JOB` file for the other job is not changed into `_SUCCESS` but we should still use the checkpoint if there is one
