Maintenance version

### Improvements

 * allow output files to be directly created during the mapping phase if possible
 * creating a _SUCCESS file in the output directory only if all Hadoop jobs are successful for a given Scoobi job. Otherwise there is only a _SUCCESS_JOB file
 * added support for partitioned sequence files
 * better implicit search for faster compilation times (thanks to @retronym)
 * compression codecs are not being used if they can't be instantiated for a given platform instead of throwing exceptions
 * created separate jars for cdh3, cdh4, cdh5, hadoop2 compatibility, instead of a Compatibility class using reflection. With cdh4/cdh5, the files of a partitioned output are 
   being moved with a single rename
