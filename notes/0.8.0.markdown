Scoobi version for Hadoop2!

### Features

 * `scoobi-0.8.0.jar` can be used with Hadoop 2.2.0. If you want to go on using CDH4 you need to use `scoobi-0.8.0-cdh4.jar`
 * added the possibility to use counters to count the number of values per mapper or reducer (see `ScoobiConfiguration`) [#297](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/297)
 * add wire format for fixed avro type [#301](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/306), PR by Jan Prach
 * added methods to read and write "partitioned" files, for example files created in directories where the name is meaningful: `year=2014/month=02/day=01/part.txt`. When reading, a `DList[(String, String)]` is created where each value is a line in the file and the key is the file path. When writing, a function `K => String` can be provided in order to output the text files to specific directories based on each key
 
### Improvements

 * extracted a `InputsOutputs.fromSource` method to create a `DList[A]` from any `DataSource[_,_,A]`
 * removed the dependency on the `ascii-graph` library
 * updated to Scala 2.10.3
 * removed deprecated methods created in `0.7.0`

### Fixes

 * fixed the usage of globs for hadoop 2 [#305](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/305)
 * fixed the setup for sequence files where previous files where not removed
 * fixed the persistence of a DObject when defined from just a value
 * In-memory mode does not keep track of hadoop counters [#306](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/306), PR by Ilya Maykov
 * MR job numbering broken in HadoopMode for job plans with more than 1 layer [#308](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/308), PR by Ilya Maykov
 * prevent extra delimiter on sequence types in listToDelimitedTextFile [#311](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/311)
 * extracted the converter used in fromTextFileWithPaths to avoid duplication [#315](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/315)
